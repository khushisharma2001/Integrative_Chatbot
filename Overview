Overview
The OHSL Chat Bot is an AI-powered chatbot designed using LLM-based search engines and frameworks like LangChain and LLaMA. This project explores how large language models improve user interactions by providing contextually relevant responses and enhancing search precision.

Features
Web Scraping & Data Extraction: A Python script scrapes and processes textual and image data from the OHSL website.
Data Preprocessing & Vector Embeddings: Converts scraped data into vector embeddings using sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2.
LLM Integration: Implements the daryl149/llama-2-7b-chat-hf model for intelligent query resolution.
Efficient Query Processing: Uses vector similarity searches for accurate and relevant responses.
User-Friendly Interface: Gradio-based UI for seamless user interactions.
Technologies Used
LLM Models: LLaMA-2, LangChain
Web Scraping: BeautifulSoup, Requests
Vector Embeddings: Hugging Face Transformers
Query Processing: LangChain + LlamaIndex
Frontend: Gradio
